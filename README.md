This repository explores Bayesian probability, Monte Carlo simulations, and decision-making under uncertainty. It features interactive and educational examples of how to quantify belief, model risk, and optimize strategies based on probabilistic thinking.

In weather_forecast: 

bayesian_weather_decision(city_name):
Uses Bayes' theorem to analyze the probability of rain given forecast accuracy and city-specific base rates. Also compares umbrella-carrying strategies based on risk minimization.

simulate_weather_predictions(city_name, num_days):
Runs a Monte Carlo simulation of the forecast vs. actual rain to empirically validate Bayes' rule and compute forecast error rates.
