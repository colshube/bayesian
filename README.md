This module provides both analytical and Monte Carlo simulation-based Bayesian reasoning examples for weather prediction.

bayesian_weather_decision(city_name):
Uses Bayes' theorem to analyze the probability of rain given forecast accuracy and city-specific base rates. Also compares umbrella-carrying strategies based on risk minimization.

simulate_weather_predictions(city_name, num_days):
Runs a Monte Carlo simulation of the forecast vs. actual rain to empirically validate Bayes' rule and compute forecast error rates.
